Summary
This paper presents a novel list‐based scheduling algorithm called Improved Predict Earliest Finish
Time for static task scheduling in a heterogeneous computing environment. The algorithm calcu-
lates the task priority with a pessimistic cost table, implements the feature prediction with a crit-
ical node cost table, and assigns the best processor for the node that has at least 1 immediate
successor as the critical node, thereby effectively reducing the schedule makespan without
increasing the algorithm time complexity. Experiments regarding aspects of randomly generated
graphs and real‐world application graphs are performed, and comparisons are made based on
the scheduling length ratio, robustness, and frequency of the best result. The results demonstrate
that the Improved Predict Earliest Finish Time algorithm outperforms the Predict Earliest Finish
Time and Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time algorithms in terms of the schedule length ratio, fre-
quency of the best result, and robustness while maintaining the same time complexity.
